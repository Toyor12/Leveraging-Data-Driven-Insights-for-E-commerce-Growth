# Leveraging-Data-Driven-Insights-for-E-commerce-Growth

In the highly competitive e-commerce landscape, optimizing business performance through data-driven insights is paramount. This project takes a comprehensive approach to untangle, 
refine, and interpret the wealth of information available in raw company data. Using a combination of MSSQL, Python, and Power BI, I structured a robust pipeline for data cleaning, integration, and visualization, culminating in an insightful business/sales dashboard that offers performance summary and actionable insights for growth.

# Objectives:

To build a reliable and scalable data pipeline by integrating SQL, Python, and Power BI.

To extract, clean, and load e-commerce raw data into a structured database using Python and MSSQL.

To transform cleaned data into meaningful business insights through effective data visualization.

To provide a business/sales dashboard that accurately reflects the company's performance and identifies potential growth opportunities.

To enable the company to make data-driven decisions by offering actionable insights drawn from the processed data.
